        "Elevate your kitchen with our premium End Grain butcher block cutting boards. All of our boards are handmade in our shop using hand selected, locally purchased domestic hardwoods. Your End Grain cutting board can be made with either Walnut, Maple, or Cherry. And of course it is 100% food safe.",
        "Each edge of the board is finished with a 1/4\" chamfer edge and grooved handles on either side for easy lifting. You may choose to add non-slip cutting board feet and/or a juice groove to help when carving meats. The board feet consist of an outer wooden ring and an inner polyurethane non-slip bumper.",

This process is more difficult and takes more time, but the results are fantastic. Structurally stronger and better looking, the increased price is well worth the investment.",
