    question: "How do I clean my cutting board?",
    answer:
      "Your cutting board is pre-treated with a food grade mineral oil and a food grade oil finish. Feel free to wash your board by scrubbing it clean with soap and water. After washing, wipe your board dry with a towel and prop it up on the countertop to fully dry. (Please DO NOT put your board in the dishwasher! Bad things will happen.) After your board has dried completely, store your board by propping it up on one edge when not in use. \n\n From time to time, based on use, you will find it beneficial to re-treat your board with a food grade mineral oil. Your local hardware store or favorite online store will sell products such as Howard Cutting Board Oil, Walrus Cutting Board Oil or similar. \n\n Apply mineral oil straight from the bottle, spread it around with your fingers or a paper towel, allow to absorb for a few minutes, then buff off with a clean paper towel. Be sure to oil both faces of the board. While there is no hard and fast rule for how often to oil a cutting board, there is a distinctive 'dry' look that wood gets when it hasn't been oiled sufficiently.",
