    question: "How do I clean my cutting board?",
    answer:
      "Your cutting board is pre-treated with a food grade mineral oil and a food grade oil finish. Feel free to wash your board by scrubbing it clean with soap and water. After washing, wipe your board dry with a towel and prop it up on the countertop to fully dry. (Please DO NOT put your board in the dishwasher! Bad things will happen.) After your board has dried completely, store your board by propping it up on one edge when not in use. \n\n From time to time, based on use, you will find it beneficial to re-treat your board with a food grade mineral oil. Your local hardware store or favorite online store will sell products such as Howard Cutting Board Oil, Walrus Cutting Board Oil or similar. \n\n Apply mineral oil straight from the bottle, spread it around with your fingers or a paper towel, allow to absorb for a few minutes, then buff off with a clean paper towel. Be sure to oil both faces of the board. While there is no hard and fast rule for how often to oil a cutting board, there is a distinctive 'dry' look that wood gets when it hasn't been oiled sufficiently.",

    question: "Why does wood species matter?",
    answer:
      "We use Maple, Walnut, Cherry and some boards have a Mahogany accent. These hardwoods have a closed grain structure which is best for a cutting board. Hardwoods such as Oak have an open grain structure which can trap bacteria. Only closed grain hardwoods used here!",
  },
  {    
    question: "Are wood cutting boards better than plastic?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Boards built with closed grain woods naturally resist bacteria. Plastic boards will break down over time and have the potential to contaminate your foods. The American Chemical Society published a study in 2023 about plastic cutting boards. They found that plastic cutting boards are a significant source of ingesting microplastics in food. Plastic cutting boards also tend to trap bacteria in the deep grooves from knife marks.",

  {
    question: "How do I store my board?",
    answer:
      "Boards with feet can be stored on their feet or on their side. Boards without feet should be stored exclusively on their side. A board without feet should not be left flat on a counter top because moisture can accumulate causing the board to warp or crack.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I place hot objects on my board?",
    answer:
      "No, do not place hot objects such as hot pots and pans on your board. This can lead to burn marks or even more serious issues like warping/cracking. Wood cutting boards should not be used as hot pads or trivets unless the pan is cool.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I remove stains?",
    answer:
      "Maple is fairly prone to staining from berries, beets, etc. Walnut is much less so. A good coat of one of the finishing oils greatly inhibits stains from occurring. But if stains happen, don’t panic! They will dissipate over time. Lemon juice and kosher salt may also help to remove stains. Do not use hydrogen peroxide, baking soda, or bleach on your board, especially on Maple! Chemicals such as those often discolor the butcher block far worse than the original stain.",
